About me
======


I am a third year PhD student between  the APO team of
 the [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/en/home/) lab and [ANITI](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/en/). I am  
currenlty working under the supervision of [Serge Gratton]( https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=q9HdQc4AAAAJ) and [Philippe L. Toint](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=yP3gz0cAAAAJ).

I am keen on developing optimization methods with provable convergence rates and test them in practise. In particular, I focus on developping second-order methods that are suited for large scale and noisy problems.
I also work on the analysis of adaptive first  order methods and algorithm's complexity analysis in determinstic or inexact settings. 

Before starting my PhD, I graduated from [&Eacute;cole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) with an engineering degree and a master's degree in applied mathematics and Computer Science [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) from [&Eacute;cole Normale Sup&#233;rieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en)
